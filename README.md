The equation editor in excel is unfortunatelly not programmable. 

But there is away a round that:
1. Create a LaTex pdf from Excel Data
2. Convert PDF in PNG
3. Import PNG in Excel
4. Crop PNG and Relocate

For the VBA example to run you need "pdflatex" and "pdftoppm" for the Code to run properly.

1. Install MikTex (includes "pdflatex")
2. Update MikTex - update all
3. Install XPDF Reader from https://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html (includes "pdftoppm")

Have fun :)
